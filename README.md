# DotComGame
 The computer will prompt you to enter a guess (a cell), which you’ll type at the command-line (as “A3”, “C5”, etc.). In response to your guess, you’ll see a result at the command-line, either “hit”, “miss”, or “You sunk Pets.com” (or whatever the lucky Dot Com of the day is). When you’ve sent all three Dot Coms to that big 404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your rating.
